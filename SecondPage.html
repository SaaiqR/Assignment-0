Meditations is the account of Marcus Aurelius's thoughts and advice written by himself. It is a book with a collection of Aurelius's private thoughts and him giving advice on how to be responsible and meet the obligations of life. Every night Aurelius took time to write reminders on having a stable character, with qualities such as humbleness, indifference, patience, etc.

  So, why should you adopt a stoic mindset? In the United states, it was approximated that about 18.5% of the population struggled with some sort of depression. In the modern world, as we are plagued with stresses all around, from busy work schedules, oor our interations with others, it can be tempting to give in and blame everyone and everything. This will just make you a bitter person and wont help youy at all. Marcus Aurelius often talks about dealing with these sorts of things. He quotes that "The best revenge is not to be like your enemy". He also quotes that "A real man doesnt give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance-unlike the angry commplaining". Marcus Aurelius teaches that when you awake in the morning say to yourself "I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together.‚Äù Adopting this way of thinking can essentially make you bulletproof to all the petty arguments, offenses, and obstacles the world throws at you, and will overall give you ppeace of mind, which is why stoicism is a very good mindset for many to adopt.
